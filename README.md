Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.

## Reverse Vowels In A String

In this kata, your goal is to write a function which will reverse the vowels in a string. Any characters which are not vowels 
should remain in their original position. Here are some examples:

```
"Hello!" => "Holle!"
"Tomatoes" => "Temotaos"
"Reverse Vowels In A String" => "RivArsI Vewols en e Streng"
```
